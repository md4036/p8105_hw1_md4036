We are first going to download the tidyverse library.

### Description of the “Penguins” dataset:

The “Penguins” dataset consists of 8 variables including species,
island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and
year. This dataset has 8 columns and 344 rows.

The mean bill length is 44mm.

The mean bill depth is 17mm.

The mean body mass is 4202g.

The mean flipper length is 201 mm.

## The Mean Flipper Length

The mean flipper length is 201 mm.

## Scatterplot with flipper length and bill length

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
ggplot (penguins, aes (x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() 
```

# Problem 2

``` r
homework1_df = 
  tibble (
    random_sample = rnorm (10),
    vec_logic = random_sample > 0,
    vec_char = c ("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("low","medium","low","high","low","high","medium","low","low","high"))
  )

homework1_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    random_sample vec_logic vec_char vec_factor
    ##            <dbl> <lgl>     <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1        2.20   TRUE      a        low

    ##  3       -1.82   FALSE     c        low       
    ##  4       -0.0119 FALSE     d        high      
    ##  5        0.645  TRUE      e        low       
    ##  6       -0.461  FALSE     f        high      
    ##  7        0.271  TRUE      g        medium    
    ##  8       -0.366  FALSE     h        low       
    ##  9        0.278  TRUE      i        low       
    ## 10       -2.56   FALSE     j        high

“random_sample” mean is -0.2904379.

“vec_logic” mean is 0.4.

“vec_char” mean is NA.

“vec_factor” mean is NA.

Since both of the “vec_char” and the “vec_factor” variables do not
consist of numeric values, they do not have mean values.

``` r
as.numeric (homework1_df$vec_logic)

as.numeric (factor(homework1_df$vec_char))

as.numeric (homework1_df$vec_factor)
```

After using as.numeric, it converted the logical, character and factor
variables into numeric values. The mean of the “vec_logic” variable is
now able to be calculated. This variable was coded as 0=FALSE and 1=TRUE
and after averaging all of the “vec_logic” results, it found the average
to be 0.4. Additionally, the “vec_char” variable was converted to
numbers 1-10 from a-j and “vec_factor” was converted and coded as 2 =
“low”, 3 = “medium”, and 1 = “high”. With this information, the means
can now be calculated for “vec_char” and “vec_factor”.
